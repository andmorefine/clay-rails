# Technology Stack

## Current Status
- **Project Phase**: Initial setup - no tech stack defined yet
- **Repository**: Git-based version control

## Build System
- No build system currently configured
- No package manager or dependency management setup

## Common Commands
Since no specific tech stack is implemented yet, standard git commands apply:

```bash
# Version control
git status
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main

# Repository management
git clone <repo-url>
git pull origin main
```

## Future Considerations
When selecting a tech stack, ensure:
- All dependencies are MIT license compatible
- Choose mature, well-supported technologies
- Document build and deployment processes
- Include testing framework setup
